# Win2000-USBstorage_Registry_Lock
USB Storage access control via windows registry.

Interface using HTML Application HTA file, to edit registry and renamed USB drivers files. Prevents errors made to Registry everytime USB storage access is required by technical staffs. 

Wrote this for work purposes due to limitation at work since disallowed to change users priviledge level due to conflict with operational out-sourced closed build softwares. Operation softwares already in placed was not budgetted for unforseen circumstances like USB access resulting in virus intrusions. And PC technician needs to use USB storage access occasionally resulted for this solution to be written.

This includes disabling Control Panel access too.
